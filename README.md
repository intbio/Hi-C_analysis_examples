# Hi-C/Micro-C data processing

Here we present the ecosystem for Hi-C/Micro-C data processing and analysis

Look at the following flowchart to see how different packages for data processing in this ecosystem interact and what data formats are supported

Basic info about working with packages can be found in the [Data_Preprocessing](https://github.com/intbio/Hi-C_analysis_examples/tree/master/Data_Preprocessing) directory

Notes about working with distiller are [here](https://github.com/intbio/Hi-C_analysis_examples/tree/master/distiller) and cooltools notebooks are [here](https://github.com/intbio/Hi-C_analysis_examples/tree/master/cooltools)

DistMan -- our pandas data science sheet for Micro-C data analysis --  notebook can be found in the [DistMan](https://github.com/intbio/Hi-C_analysis_examples/tree/master/DistMan) directory

In order to integrate nucleosomes positioning data with nucleosomal resolution Micro-C data our script [MM-Integrator](https://github.com/intbio/Hi-C_analysis_examples/blob/master/Data%20Integration/MM-Integrator.ipynb) can be used
