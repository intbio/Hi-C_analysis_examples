# Hi-C/Micro-C data processing

Here we present the system for Hi-C/Micro-C data processing and analysis

Look at the following flowchart to see how different packages for data processing in this ecosystem interact and what data formats are supported

![](https://github.com/intbio/Hi-C_analysis_examples/blob/master/FlowchartHiC.jpg)

Basic info about working with packages can be found in the [Data_Preprocessing](https://github.com/intbio/Hi-C_analysis_examples/tree/master/Data_Preprocessing) directory

Notes about working with distiller are [here](https://github.com/intbio/Hi-C_analysis_examples/tree/master/distiller) and cooltools notebooks are [here](https://github.com/intbio/Hi-C_analysis_examples/tree/master/cooltools)

DistMan -- our pandas data science sheet for Micro-C data analysis --  notebook can be found in the [DistMan](https://github.com/intbio/Hi-C_analysis_examples/tree/master/DistMan) directory

In order to integrate nucleosomes positioning data with nucleosomal resolution Micro-C data our script [MM-Integrator](https://github.com/intbio/Hi-C_analysis_examples/blob/master/Data%20Integration/MM-Integrator.ipynb) can be used

Notes on using Micro-C data for nucleosome positioning can be found [here](https://github.com/intbio/Hi-C_analysis_examples/blob/master/Data_Preprocessing/Using_Micro-C_for_positioning)

 # MNase-seq, ChIP-seq data processing
Also here you can get a glimpse of our approach to process other 3D-genomics data:

This is a flowchart depicting our MNase-seq data processing pipeline

This is a flowchart of the ChIP-Seq/Micro-C integration (based on the approach presented in Hsieh et al.,2020)
