Signal tracks: For nucleosome occupancy data, the first read of the Micro-C read pairs  map with Bowtie2 (2.3.2) and Samtools (1.4.1)
Against the human genome (hg38) using the following parameters:
(bowtie2 -p 16â€“local -x {hg38 bowtie2 genome} -U {fastq.file} | samtools view -bS -o {output.bam} -) 2 > &1 | tee {report.file})
To compute the nucleosome dyad density, the resulting read starts were shifted by 73 bp (strand sensitive) to obtain the theoretical nucleosome dyad
